# Procurement & Sales Management System (ERP Tool) + Sample E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the official repository for our internship project **Procurement & Sales Management System**, developed using **Infor ERP LN**. This project also includes a visually engaging sample frontend website created purely for UI demonstration.

## 🔧 Project Overview

This repository contains:

1. **ERP System (Backend - Infor LN):**  
   A full-fledged enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that handles procurement, sales, invoicing, returns, and payments. The system is built on **Infor ERP LN**, following a modular and data-driven architecture — similar to platforms like eBay/OLX.

2. **Sample Frontend Website (NexusMarket):**  
   A modern, theme-rich UI designed using HTML/CSS to visualize how an e-commerce interface might look. This is **not connected to the ERP backend** and serves only as a conceptual demo for the front-end experience.
